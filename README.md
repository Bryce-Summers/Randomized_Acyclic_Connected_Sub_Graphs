# Randomized_Acyclic_Connected_Sub_Graphs
A Final project for the 15-418 class at Carnegie Mellon University.

Description
-------

This code parrallelizes and achieves a speedup for an algorithm for constructing mazes using a union find structure.

We have implemented many parrallel friendly Union find structures. Of particular note, please see our 3 implementations of lock free union find structures, where each one uses a different path compression strategy.

Visualization Tool
-----------------

To visualize the outputs of this program, one may feed a list of integers representing the edges output by this program
as the input to the Graph Renderer program at https://github.com/Bryce-Summers/JavaCode/tree/master/GraphRenderer

We have not yet made this proccess very user friendly.
