Unit tests passed.
Corectness tests passed.

Maze size = 100 by 100.

Maze Time = 1140000 clockticks
Maze Time = 1210000 clockticks
Maze Time = 1140000 clockticks
Maze Time = 1150000 clockticks

5/7/2015 -- UF_Serial, UF_Full_locking

UF_Serial Time = 1280 kilo clockticks
Parrallel 4-threads, Full Locking Time = 80 kilo clockticks

UF_Serial Time = 1510 kilo clockticks
Parrallel 4-threads, Full Locking Time = 80 kilo clockticks

UF_Serial Time = 1320 kilo clockticks
Parrallel 4-threads, Full Locking Time = 60 kilo clockticks


I think this improvement implies that the majority of the work was being done in the iteration variables.

I investigated the discrepancy and found that the serial implementation had a bunch of overhead in its handling of conflicts.

UF_Serial Time = 20 kilo clockticks
Parrallel 4-threads, Full Locking Time = 110 kilo clockticks

Now it looks like the locking is a major overhead.


Questions:

Serial shuffling and combining parts of the computations: Think of AMdahl's law.

What is the time for the correctness checks?
