Discuss that we have developed the algorithm and data structures ourselves.

The motivation for randomization is to give the user choice. Show simple non randomized procedures for the graphs.

Discuss traditional array based maze creation algorithms.

notes on Amdahl's law. The user would need to parallelize the randomization and other functions.

Hand over hand probably does not work well, because the paths to the critical nodes are convergent, not divergent.
